# Image Editing with Segment Anything Model

## Overview

This project uses Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for advanced image segmentation and editing. SAM is an AI model designed to identify and segment objects in images with minimal human input, enabling powerful image manipulation capabilities.

## Features

- Object segmentation in images
- Image editing based on segmentation masks
- Jupyter notebook demonstrating the workflow

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Additional dependencies listed in the requirements section

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image_edit.git
   cd image_edit
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision opencv-python matplotlib
   pip install segment-anything
   ```

3. Download the SAM checkpoint (if needed):
   ```
   wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
   ```

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook

The project includes a Jupyter notebook (`sam.ipynb`) that demonstrates the entire workflow:

1. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```
   or
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `sam.ipynb` and follow the instructions within the notebook.

### Sample Images

The `content` directory contains sample images that you can use to test the functionality.

## How It Works

1. The Segment Anything Model identifies objects in your image
2. You can select specific objects to edit
3. Apply transformations to the selected segments
4. Export the edited image

## Examples

[Include example images here showing before/after edits]
